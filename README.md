# Python Personal Assistant

## Overview
This project implements a modular Python-based personal assistant designed to
perform everyday utility and automation tasks through user commands. The focus
is on clean software structure, extensibility, and practical automation rather
than complex user interfaces.

## Problem Statement
Many daily computing tasks require repetitive manual actions. A lightweight
personal assistant can automate common tasks, improve productivity, and serve
as a foundation for more advanced assistant systems.

## System Description
The personal assistant operates by receiving user commands (text or voice-based)
and routing them to appropriate functional modules. Each module handles a
specific category of tasks, allowing the system to be easily extended with
additional capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Standard Python libraries
- Optional: Speech Recognition libraries
- Optional: Text-to-Speech libraries

## Key Features
- Command-based interaction
- Modular task handling
- Utility functions (time, system info, file operations, queries)
- Easily extensible design
- Platform-independent execution

## Project Status
Core assistant logic implemented. Code cleanup and modular refinement in
progress.

## Future Enhancements
- Voice-based command support
- API integrations (weather, search, reminders)
- Configuration file support
- Improved natural language parsing
